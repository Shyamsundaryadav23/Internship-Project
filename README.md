## Architecture

HomelyHub is built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**, replicating the core functionalities of platforms like Airbnb.  

- **MongoDB**: Stores property, user, and booking data.  
- **Express.js**: Handles server-side logic and API endpoints.  
- **React**: Builds a dynamic, responsive user interface for property listings and bookings.  
- **Node.js**: Serves as the runtime environment for server-side execution, ensuring smooth communication between front-end and back-end.  

The project follows a **modular structure** with components for user authentication, property search, and booking features. **Redux** is used for efficient state management, and **RESTful APIs** facilitate client-server communication, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
